  title:        "I2C to SPI Bridge"
  author:       "vermiscore"
  discord:      ""
  description:  "An I2C-to-SPI protocol bridge. Acts as an I2C peripheral device; accepts I2C write transactions and translates them into SPI master transactions on a configurable SPI bus."
  language:     "Verilog"
  clock_hz:     10000000   # 10 MHz — adjust to your target frequency

  # Source files (relative to src/).  List ALL Verilog files used.
  source_files:
    - project.v
    - i2c_peripheral.v
    - spi_master.v
    - bridge_ctrl.v

  top_module:   "tt_um_vermiscore_i2c_spi_bridge"

  # Pinout — identical to the TT standard (8-bit ui_in, 8-bit uo_out, 8-bit uio)
  # I2C uses open-drain lines; you will need external pull-ups on the PCB.
